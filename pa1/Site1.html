        <p>HTTP is the protocol for the transmission of data on the web.
        It is a client-server protocol. This means that the reciepient makes
        the requests. The recipeient will typically be the web browser.
        Communication is done by sending individual messages. Clien messages
        are called <i>requests</i>. Server messages are called <i>responses</i>

        <h3>HTTP Components</h3>
        <p>Requests are sent to the server. In betweent the server and the client
        are proxies. For a web page to appear on one's computer the browser
        makes a request for an html document. The browser then puts together
        the CSS, javascript and images to form the entire web page. The server
        sends the data that the client requests. Proxies forward messages on
        their way from the client to the server. They also perform services
        such as caching, filtering and authentication.
