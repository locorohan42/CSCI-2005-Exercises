        <p>After all of the groundwork for a website has been layed down a
          web browser is the key vehicle for the user experience. All a user
          has to do is know the URL of a website and the browser will do everything
          for them making it an easy, quick and seamless experience. The browser
          will retrieve the html and css to render the webpage.

        <h3>Modern Web Browsers</h3>
        <p>In the past web browsers were very simple. Their task was simply to
          display webpages. Now search engines are integreated, there is URL
          autocompletion and passwords can be stored along with the generation
          of random passwords that are hard to hack. There are also web browser
          extensions which is essentially added functionality to the web browser.
          Some of extensions include AdBlock, custom cursors, spell checkers
          and screen capture services.
