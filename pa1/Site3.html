        <p>HTML can be thought of more as the structure of a document. In reality
          HTML should not be used for formatting web pages. That's where
          Cascading Style Sheets comes in. CSS is used to make the page look a
          certain way. It delegates things such as fonts, colors, sizes and
          it is added to an HTML directly using a style attribute even though
          the CSS file will be in a different location than the HTML file.

        <h3>Why CSS?</h3>
        <p>One might think that since HTML has functionality built in for styling
          a webpage that something like CSS that is layed on top if it doesn't
          really make any sense. In reality there are a lot of good reasons for
          CSS. Sites can have more flexibilty when it comes to output and formatting,
          sites are easily maintanable, accessibly and faster to download since
          the HTML files will be a lot smaller since it doesn't contain information
          about formatting.
