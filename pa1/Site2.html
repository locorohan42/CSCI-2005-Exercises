        <p>While servers are the part of the internet web browsers collect data to from
          the websites on computers how are they implemented? Since busy sites may get
          thousands of requests a second multiple machines may be run in parallel to handle
          the heavy loads. A server farm is where multiple machines are running in parallel.
          Load balancers are machines that divert traffic accordingly to different machines.

        <h3>Server Farm</h3>
        <p>At a first glance it's not immediatly obvious why a server farm is desired.
          It consists of a large amount of expensive computers that are different
          than ordinary personal computers that can handly heavy loads. Big power
          means big heat so money must be invested in ensuring that these server
          farm facilities are kept very cool. For a web application having a server
          farm means failure redundancy as others servers are ready in case one fails.
          In the realm of cluster computing upercomputers also utilize server farm
          layouts.
