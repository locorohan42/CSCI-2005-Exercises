        <p>There are many aspects to web development. Some developers will only
          have knowledge in the front end aspects such as HTML, CSS and javascript.
          A full stack developer is like a jack of all trades having experience
          in in the front end, back end, databases and mobile app development.The
          full stack is essentially everything required to complete a project.
          This level of knowledge lends itself to full stack developers being
          payed well and in high demand in the web devlopment industries.

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <p>It's a very useful asset for a company to have a full stack developer.
          They will have a good idea of how to create a project due to the
          horizontal knowledge across technologies. They can also communicate
          with the entire team due to familiarity with a vast realm of
          technologies. The only issue is a full stack developer will not be
          an expert in any one field. So it might be misleading that since
          they are comfortable with many technologies that they will have the
          best solutions for a specific technology at a given time.
